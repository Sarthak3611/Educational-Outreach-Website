              Educational outreach refers to efforts made by educational institutions, organizations, or individuals to engage
              with communities beyond their immediate academic setting. These efforts aim to share knowledge, resources,
              and opportunities with various groups, such as students, teachers, parents, and the general public, to promote
              learning, skill development, and awareness.
